# Convex-Hull-Algorithms
Implement the following algorithms for constructing the convex hull:-
1. Gift wrapping algorithm
2. Graham scan algorithm
3. Quickhull

Comparison chart between those two algorithms.
5 test cases with number of points as (n = )100, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000
and 3 test cases with varying number of points on the hull;
one of those should be n atleast (i.e. equal to the number of points)
